# Task-manager-BOM-Challenge-
"I built this website to help you manage your daily tasks. You can easily create, read, update, and delete tasks, and all your work is automatically saved in local storage, so itâ€™s available whenever you return.  This project was inspired and developed while following the Elzero JavaScript course on YouTube." <br>
